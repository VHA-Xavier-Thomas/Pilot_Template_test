This section establishes the data design of the pilot from both internal and external data sources. Data design requires the collection of data models and architecture of potential providers to build a common schema to provision interoperability for data collection. 
This process initializes the business model,  workflow, and data architecture around data collection.
The initial design should state what is optimal and a gap analysis will be defined to determine whether software creation and/or implementation is required for enhanced and streamlined data collection.
