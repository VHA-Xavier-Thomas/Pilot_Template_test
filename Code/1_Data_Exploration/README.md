## All Reference Data must be standardized across a pilot before moving forward.
Typically these domains are different for each location but must be consolidated and checked across sources: 
VA-Inpat- dim, 
VA-Outpat/DSS- DSS_DIM,
ndim-PIT, ndim-MVI

Reference data may require crosswalks for patients, locations, etc.
